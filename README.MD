Learn Python the Hard Way 3rd Edition

I am going back through Python basics and following the exercises in this book to continue education.

I am using an updated string interpolation with f-strings instead of the string formatting that is used in the book to keep up with Python3 syntax.

I will use this readme file as a way to update any issues or problems I have along the way
