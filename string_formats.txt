# String formats - define and use to demonstrate what they does

Python uses C-style string formatting to create new, formatted strings. The % operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a 'tuple (fixed sized list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with an argument specifier like %s

%d = Integers

%e/E = exponents


%f = Floating point numbers

%.<number of digits>f - floating point numbers with a fixed amount of digits to the right of the dot. 

%g/%G = general format, rounds number to p significant digits

%i = 

%o = octal format

%u = 

%s = String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)

%x/%X = Integers in hex representation 

%c = represents character values

%r = calls the repr(), returns a printable representation of the given object

%s = string

%% = % symbol after a substitution symbol
